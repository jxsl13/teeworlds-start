This folder contains all of your server modifications that you want to host servers with.
On Linux and macOS those server files do not have any file extension, on Windows they are usually called .exe files.
The vanilla Teeworlds server is called `teeworlds_srv` on Linux and macOS and `teeworlds_srv.exe` on Windows.
